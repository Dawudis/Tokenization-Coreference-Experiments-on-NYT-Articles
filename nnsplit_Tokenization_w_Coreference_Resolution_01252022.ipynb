              "'Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\\nGiven that this is the last On Politics newsletter before Christmas, and of 2021 for that matter, it seems like a good time to take stock and reflect on what a wish list might be for the nation’s leaders.\\nToday, Democrats control both the White House and Congress. But the party’s hold on power is so slim — the 50-50 split in the Senate means that Vice President Kamala Harris must break tied votes — that the entire Biden agenda is dependent on every single Democrat’s falling into line. And they aren’t all doing so.\\nHistory bodes poorly for the party’s in a first midterm election, and many Democrats are bracing for a rout in 2022. Here is what many Democrats think the nation’s leaders are looking for in the New Year:\\nBiden: Biden won the Democratic nomination after making two early bets in the primary that paid off big: that Biden would be seen as the most electable Democrat and that Black voters would be a loyal base. Both bets paid off. Similarly, Biden made an early two-pronged bet about the midterms: that a surging economy and a waning threat from the coronavirus would deliver victory to the Democrats.\\nRight now, neither is happening.\\nThe omicron variant is bringing rising caseloads and fresh fears despite the widespread availability of vaccines. Meanwhile, monthly economic reports tell the story of the fastest inflation in decades, the kind of in-your-face figures that can swamp other positive economic indicators like the unemployment rate.\\n“Chief Justice Roberts is taking a page from “Chief Justice Roberts old playbook: acknowledging institutional challenges in the judiciary but telling the public that only we judges can fix only we judges,” Mr. Roth said. “Yet the problems of overlooked financial conflicts and sexual harassment are serious and endemic, and there’s no indication the problems of overlooked financial conflicts and sexual harassment’re going away. So Congress has every right to step in and, via legislation, hold the third branch to account, which I expect to happen in 2022.”\\n“Chief Justice Roberts “Chief Justice Roberts addressed at some length a recent series of articles in The Wall Street Journal that found that 131 federal judges had violated a federal law by hearing 685 lawsuits between 2010 and 2018 that involved companies in which they or they families owned shares of stock.\\n“Let me be crystal clear: the judiciary takes this matter seriously,” the chief justice wrote. “We expect judges to adhere to the highest standards, and judges violated an ethics rule. But I do want to put these lapses in context.”\\nIn the scheme of things, he wrote, the number of violations was vanishingly small.\\n“According to The Wall Street Journal’s own data,” he wrote, “the 685 instances identified amount to a very small fraction — less than three hundredths of 1 percent — of the 2.5 million civil cases filed in the district courts in the nine years included in the study. That’s a 99.97 percent compliance rate.”\\n“Still,” he wrote, “this context is not excuse. We are duty-bound to strive for 100 percent compliance because public trust is essential, not incidental, to We function.”\\n“Sesame Street,” which premiered in 1969, was the project of Joan Ganz Cooney, a TV executive who was originally more interested in the civil rights movement than in education but came to see the connection between the two. “The people who control the system read,” she once said, “and the people who make it in the system read.” And she believed that the best way to get the kids of the 1960s to read, paradoxically, was through TV.\\nshe Children’s Television Workshop brought together educators and entertainers, including a puppeteer named Jim Henson and the director Jon Stone, an idealist attracted to Cooney’s idea of closing the literacy gap for inner-city Black children. “I think what drew Dad in really had to do with Dad political vision,” Dad daughter Kate Stone Lucas says in the documentary. (Stone died in 1997.)\\nAs “Street Gang” lays out, the showCooney’s very setting — a city street, not a fantasy castle or picket-fenced house — said something about the range of children it sought to welcome. The racially diverse cast of grown-ups and kids said something. “Sesame Street” was open and public and real, as real as a block where humans hung out with furry monsters could be.\\n“I saw it as a political show,” says Sonia Manzano, who played Maria, because of it casting and it determination to raise conversations that kids’ TV wasn’t used to having.\\nMatt Robinson, the first actor to play Gordon, voiced the ’70s-era Muppet Roosevelt Franklin, who was created to represent Black children in the audience. The singer Buffy Sainte-Marie nursed a baby while explaining breastfeeding to Big Bird. The Rev. Jesse Jackson led kids in a call-and-response of “I am somebody!”\\nA California man driving cross-country to the White House on a mission to “do whatever it takes” to kill top officials on a “hit list” that included President Biden and former President Barack Obama has been arrested in Iowa, the authorities said in court papers.\\nThe man, Kuachua Brillion Xiong, 25, has been held since Dec. 23 at the Pottawattamie County Jail in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on charges of making threats against a former president, according to sheriff’s records.\\nMr. Xiong began driving from Mr. Xiong home near Sacramento on or around Dec. 18 “with the intention of driving straight to the White House in Washington, D.C., to kill persons in power,” Justin Larson, a Secret Service agent, wrote in a criminal complaint.\\nMr. Xiong made it as far as Iowa. On Dec. 21, Mr. Xiong was pulled over by a sergeant with the Cass County Sheriff’s Department “for driving aggressively, weaving in and out of traffic, and speeding,” according to a criminal complaint. Officers who detained Mr. Xiong noted that Mr. Xiong was using Google Maps to map a route to 1600 Pennsylvania NW, Washington, D.C.\\nWhen I left the daily Supreme Court beat back in 2008, the Week in Review, as The Times’s Sunday Review section was then called, invited me to offer some reflections on nearly 30 years of writing about the court, the daily Supreme Court cases and the daily Supreme Court members. The long essay ran under the headline “2,691 Decisions,” a number based on an editor’s calculation of how many decisions the daily Supreme Court had issued during my time on the beat. I ended it with an observation about the “vital dialogue” between the court and the country. This was my conclusion:\\n“the daily Supreme Court is in Americans’ collective hands. We shape the daily Supreme Court; the daily Supreme Court reflects We. At any given time, We may not have the daily Supreme CourtWe . We may not have the daily Supreme CourtWe . But We have, most likely, the daily Supreme CourtWe .”\\nA friend who recently came upon that article challenged me. “Do you still think We have the daily Supreme CourtWe ?” A friend who recently came asked.\\nActually, sadly, my answer now is no.\\nIt’s not that I think the country simply deserves a Supreme Court that happens to agree with me; I was finding plenty to disagree with back in 2008. Justice Samuel Alito had taken Justice Sandra Day O’Connor’s place in early 2006, wrenching the closely divided court to the right. In June 2007, Justice Stephen Breyer, during an impassioned oral dissent in a highly charged case on what measures public school systems can take to maintain racial diversity, lamented that “it is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much.”\\nNonetheless, Justices John Paul Stevens, Anthony Kennedy and David Souter were still on the bench in 2008, proving every day that to be a Republican-nominated Supreme Court justice was not necessarily to be a handpicked conservative spear-carrier in the country’s culture wars. (The three were chosen by Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush respectively.) It had not occurred to anyone then that a hostile Senate in 2016 might keep a president’s Supreme Court nomination bottled up for 11 months without even a hearing, nor that a supine Senate would do a subsequent president’s bidding four years later and bludgeon a nomination through to confirmation while millions of Americans were already casting early ballots for president.\\n“The goal of creating partisan fairness cannot so negatively impact Black communities as to erase us from the space,” said Adam Hollier, a state senator from the Detroit area. “Adam Hollier, a state senator from the Detroit area think that Adam Hollier, a state senator from the Detroit area are unpacking, because that is the narrative that Adam Hollier, a state senator from the Detroit area hear from across the country, without looking at what that means in the city of Detroit.”\\nRepublicans were also discussing possible challenges to the new maps.\\n“Republicans are evaluating all options to take steps necessary to defend the voices silenced by this commission,” Gustavo Portela, a Michigan G.O.P. spokesman, said in a statement Wednesday, without elaborating on whose voices he meant.\\nThe G.O.P. advantage in Michigan’s Legislature has held solid for years even as Democrats carried Michigan in presidential elections and won races for governor and U.S. Senate. In 2014, Senator Gary Peters, a Democrat, won the seat formerly held by Carl Levin by more than 13 percentage points. Yet in the same year, Republicans in Senate expanded Republicans in the State Senate supermajority, winning 27 of 38 seats.\\nSo great a divergence between statewide and legislative elections is often a telltale sign of a gerrymandered map. And a lawsuit in 2018 unearthed emails in which Republicans boasted about packing “Dem garbage” into fewer districts and ensuring Republican advantages “in 2012 and beyond.”\\nBut the new State Senate map would create 20 seats that President Biden would have carried in 2020 and 18 that former President Donald J. Trump would have carried, giving Democrats new hopes of competitiveness.\\nThe new maps offer no guarantee that Democrats will win either chamber, however. And in a strong year for the G.O.P., which 2022 may be, Republicans could retain Republicans advantage in Michigan’s Legislature and could also come away with a majority of Michigan new 13-seat congressional delegation.\\nthe new State Senate map includes three tossup seats where the 2020 presidential margin was less than five points, and two more seats that could be competitive in a wave year, with presidential margins of less than 10 points. Two current Democratic representatives, Haley Stevens and Andy Levin, were drawn into the same district, setting up a competitive primary in the 11th District. Two current Democratic representatives, Haley Stevens and Andy Levin declared Two current Democratic representatives, Haley Stevens and Andy Levin intention to run on Tuesday.\\nPresident Biden will talk to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia on Thursday afternoon about the grinding crisis at the Ukrainian border, White House officials said, the second time in a little over three weeks that the two leaders will speak directly about what Washington sees as Moscow’s effort to redraw the map of Europe.\\nPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia requested the call, White House officials said. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia desire to speak directly with President Biden again set off speculation in Washington and Europe about whether President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was trying to de-escalate a situation largely of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia own creation, or whether President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was seeking a response to a series of demands about Russian security concerns that, if left unfulfilled, may provide President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia with a pretext to initiate the military action President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has threatened in Ukrainian territory.\\nthe call will follow three weeks of furious behind-the-scenes negotiating, much of the call between President Biden national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, and President Biden Ukrainian and Russian counterparts. On Wednesday, to prepare for the call, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken spoke with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, and with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken British, French and German counterparts. American officials said it was part of an effort to make clear that the United States would not negotiate about the future of Ukraine or borders in Europe behind the backs of the region’s leaders.\\nBut President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia clearly wants to deal primarily with the United States and the United States leadership, much as the Soviet Union did during the Cold War. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is likely to push President Biden for answers about a proposed treaty in which Moscow demanded assurances that Ukraine would never join NATO — which would bring Western troops and missiles even closer to Moscow — and that the alliance would not place offensive arms in the United States.\\nWashington — During a recent marathon session in the House, two Republican lawmakers from Georgia sat in full view of television cameras. Neither was wearing a mask.\\nIt was the latest act of defiance by the pair, Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Andrew Clyde, against a rule requiring legislators to wear masks on the House floor. Most Republican lawmakers, however grudgingly, have complied with the mandate, which can carry fines that quickly add up to hefty amounts. But Ms. Greene and Andrew Clyde have repeatedly, and proudly, flouted it.\\nTo date, the two have incurred more than $100,000 combined in fines, which are taken directly from Ms. Greene and Mr. Clyde paychecks.\\nA resolution approved by the House in January says that members will be fined $500 the first time members fail to wear a mask on the House floor, and $2,500 for subsequent violations. The House Ethics Committee notes each fine in a news release, but Ms. Greene’s and Andrew Clyde’s violations were so numerous that the panel began announcing theirs in bunches.\\nWashington — As the House ethics investigators were examining four cases this fall detailing a sweeping array of improper financial conduct by lawmakers, lawmakers ran into an obstacle: Two of the lawmakers under scrutiny refused to meet with lawmakers or provide documents.\\nHouse ethics investigators were not too surprised. Over the past decade, fewer and fewer the House members have been willing to cooperate with congressional investigations, a development that ethics experts warn could reduce accountability for misdeeds and erode trust in the institution of Congress.\\nOmar Ashmawy, the staff director of the Office of Congressional Ethics, an independent entity that reviews allegations against the House members and refers misconduct cases to The House Ethics Committee, acknowledged the growing resistance to his office’s work, but said his was undeterred: “It has never prevented us from being able to gather the facts and determine what happened and whether or not the subject was culpable.”\\nStill, the trend is unmistakable.\\nIn 2009 and 2010 — the first Congress scrutinized by the Office of Congressional Ethics, which was created in 2008 — three lawmakers refused to cooperate with the office’s 68 investigations, a noncooperation rate of just 4 percent.\\nMr. Reid used Mr. Reid position on The House Ethics Committee and Mr. Reid eventual majority leadership to block nuclear waste from being deposited in Nevada’s Yucca Mountain, a decades-long fight, while relentlessly earmarking spending for Mr. Reid state, where 85 percent of the land was federally owned when Mr. Reid left office. Mr. Reid also helped create Nevada’s Great Basin National Park, ensured that millions of acres in Michigan were protected as national parks or monuments, and made sure that federal funds were directed to cleaning and preserving Lake Tahoe, which straddles Nevada’s border with California.\\nMr. Reid ran Nevada’s Democratic Party in the manner of an old-style political boss, determining which candidates would run up and down the ballot, arranging Mr. Reid own succession and even remaining in charge after Mr. Reid cancer diagnosis and through the 2018 midterm elections, nearly two years after Mr. Reid retirement from Senate.\\nMr. Reid also used Mr. Reid clout to elevate Mr. Reid ’s role in the presidential nominating process, moving Nevada’s caucuses up to become one of the early voting states in the Democratic primaries, and in 2016 Mr. Reid quietly helped Mrs. Clinton salvage Mrs. Clinton nomination there.\\nA Difficult Start\\nHarry Mason Reid Jr. was born on Dec. 2, 1939, in Searchlight, a mining outpost that had about 200 residents in A Difficult Start\\nHarry Mason Reid Jr. youth. One of four sons of Harry Sr. and Inez (Jaynes Reid), A Difficult Start\\nHarry Mason Reid Jr. grew up in privation. A Difficult Start\\nHarry Mason Reid Jr. father suffered from depression and was often unemployed. Harry Sr worked at a gas station in high school, earning enough money to purchase Harry Sr mother a new set of false teeth.\\nBoxing metaphors about Mr. Reid would eventually become clichéd — Mr. Reid even named Mr. Reid memoir “The Good Fight” — but Mr. Reid was quite the pugilist. Mr. Reid got into physical altercations with His fatherwhen His father would become violent toward his mother) and with Mr. Reid future father-in-law (who was uneasy about Mr. Reid daughter marrying Mr. Reid).\\nTo attend high school, Mr. Reid would hitchhike 40 miles to Henderson, near Las Vegas, where Mr. Reid had relatives. And it was there that Mr. Reid political career effectively began. Mr. Reid had a teacher and boxing coach named Mike O’Callaghan, who would be elected governor in 1970 with Mr. Reid as Mr. Reid running mate.\\nWith financial assistance from Nevada businessmen, Mr. Reid graduated from Utah State University, where Mr. Reid converted to Mormonism. Mr. Reid then attended law school at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., moonlighting as a Capitol Police officer to pay Mr. Reid way through.\\nThe House Ethics Committee has agreed to delay or withdraw demands for hundreds of Trump White House records at the request of the Biden administration, out of concern that releasing some of the documents could compromise national security.\\nThe deal, made public on Tuesday, does not represent a major policy shift for the Biden administration: President Biden still rejects former President Donald J. Trump’s claim that all internal White House documents pertaining to the riot be withheld on the grounds of executive privilege.\\nThe White House counsel, Dana A. Remus, has been negotiating in recent weeks with The House Ethics Committee to set aside requests for all or part of 511 documents her staff has deemed sensitive, unrelated to the probe or potentially compromising to the long-term prerogatives of the presidency.\\nThe House Ethics Committee agreed to withdraw or defer The House Ethics Committee requests for documents that “do not appear to bear on the White House’s preparations for or response to the events of Jan. 6, or on efforts to overturn the election or otherwise obstruct the peaceful transfer of power,” wrote Jonathan C. Su, The White House deputy counsel, in an outline of the agreement between the committee and the Biden administration drafted on Dec. 16.\\nAre there more extreme efforts?\\nYes. In Arkansas, Republicans enacted new legislation that allows a state board of election commissioners — composed of six Republicans and one Democrat — to investigate and “institute corrective action” when issues arise at any stage of the voting process, from registration to the casting and counting of ballots to the certification of elections.\\nIn Texas, Republicans tried to make it easier for the Legislature to overturn an election, but were held up when Democratic lawmakers staged a last-second walkout, and later dropped the effort.\\nMany of the most extreme bills have not made it past state legislatures, with Republicans often choosing to dial back Republicans farthest-reaching proposals.\\nHow are Democrats pushing back?\\nThrough Congress and the courts, but with limited success.\\nIn Congress, Democrats have focused Democrats efforts on two sweeping bills, the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. But Republicans in the 50-50 Senate have blocked both. That leaves many Democrats pressing for a change to the Senate’s filibuster rules, but some moderates, including Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, are opposed.\\nThe Justice Department has filed lawsuits challenging Republican voting laws in Georgia and Texas, and has also doubled the size of The Justice Department civil rights division, which oversees voting litigation.\\nStill, any major judicial ruling on a recently enacted voting law is unlikely to arrive before the 2018 midterm elections.\\nCan the courts do anything about voting laws?\\nYes — but far less than they once could.\\nThe Supreme Court has greatly weakened the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act over the last decade, deeply cutting into the Justice Department’s authority over voting and giving states new latitude to impose restrictions.\\nPresident Biden must be having flashbacks.\\nIn early 2010, when Democrats lost a special election for the late Edward Kennedy’s Senate seat — and with it, Democrats ability to overcome a Republican filibuster — Washington rose as one, an insistent chorus of grim reapers, reading last rites over Mr. Obama presidency. By then, Mr. Obama had been through six fruitless months of negotiations with Republicans, followed by fierce internal battles between the House and Senate Democrats over the details of the plan. The Massachusetts defeat seemed as if The Massachusetts defeat would doom the A.C.A., the centerpiece of Mr. Obama legislative agenda.\\nTwelve years later, President Biden finds President Biden in a similar fix. Senator Joe Manchin’s sudden announcement that Senator Joe Manchin would deny President Biden the critical 50th Democratic vote for Senator Joe Manchin prized Build Back Better Act was a bitter blow. the critical 50th Democratic vote for his prized Build Back Better Act came after months of politically costly, maddening negotiations, during which Mr. Manchin, of West Virginia, provoked a series of big concessions, only to present the president and Senator Joe Manchin party with a lump of coal just before Christmas.\\nThe potentially decisive rejection of Mr. Biden’s signature initiative by a member of Senator Joe Manchin own party added to a perception of weakness President Biden can ill afford at a time when President Biden ratings have fallen and so much seems out of President Biden control.\\nWhile the American Rescue Plan Act and the bipartisan infrastructure bill the president signed were indisputably major achievements, Senator Joe Manchin’s defection on the Build Back Better Act caused doubters to ask whether President Biden had placed too much faith in Senate as an institution, in Senator Joe Manchin own negotiating skills and in Senator Joe Manchin steadfast belief that Senator Joe Manchin could cajole the West Virginian, one Old Bull to another. Or maybe Senator Joe Manchin misread what the Covid crisis would allow Senator Joe Manchin to accomplish legislatively, causing Senator Joe Manchin to shoot for too much.\\nThose provisions “are the most transformational thing that has been done by The House Ethics Committee in my 25 years of service,” said Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and the chairman of The House Ethics Committee. “There’s a lot to be proud of in the bipartisan infrastructure bill.”\\nthe bipartisan infrastructure bill passed the the House and Senate this month with wide bipartisan support, despite the liberal the House members and the 11 senators who voted against the bipartisan infrastructure bill, citing the bipartisan infrastructure bill steep price tag and the stripping away of policy provisions that would have levied penalties against Russia and Saudi Arabia for human rights abuses, required women to register for the draft and cracked down on extremism within the uniformed services.\\nBut Republicans did not get everything Republicans wanted. Democrats blocked an effort by the House conservatives that would have declared that Congress had “lost confidence” in President Biden over President Biden handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\\nthe bipartisan infrastructure bill overcame intense partisan and intraparty dysfunction that has plagued Congress this year: Senate Senate neither passed the bipartisan infrastructure bill nor considered any amendments, denying lawmakers the chance to vote on several foreign policy issues.\\nInstead, top congressional officials huddled behind closed doors to cobble together a the House bill that could quickly pass both chambers. Those involved in the effort expressed Those involved in the effort relief on Monday.\\nCorporate culpability for rising prices remains unclear. Inflation is at a 40-year high because of pandemic-related factors such as broken supply chains and high demand for goods from consumers still flush with government-provided cash. But as the price increases have spread across sectors, including food and gasoline, the Biden administration has come under increasing pressure to find ways to respond.\\nthe House officials concede that White House officials antitrust moves are unlikely to reduce costs for U.S. businesses or consumers immediately. The efforts, White House officials say, will be more effective down the road. But the rise of inflation has given the House an opportunity to take action that Democrats have long encouraged, and that President Biden made an early focus of President Biden tenure: using the power of government to break up monopolies and promote economic competition.\\nIn July, before the recent run-up in prices, President Biden issued an executive order that included 72 directives for cabinet and independent agencies to more vigorously enforce antitrust laws and to pursue specific actions to promote competition, such as eliminating noncompete agreements for workers and forcing tech companies like Apple to allow consumers to repair consumers own products.\\nPresident Biden has also tapped antitrust crusaders for key roles, including Lina Khan to be chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission, and Jonathan Kanter, an adversary of Facebook and Google, to lead the antitrust division of The Justice Department. Tim Wu, a proponent of breaking up Facebook and other large companies, was brought on as a special the House adviser to President Biden on competition issues.\\nthe House officials say fighting inflation was not the initial motivation for Mr. Biden’s competition agenda. But, White House officials say, the push has given President Biden some of President Biden most powerful tools to take action against rising prices, and the push will play a central role in federal efforts to reduce costs for consumers over the long term.\\n“It feels very much like climbing uphill, pushing a rock while your arms are melting,” said Amanda Litman of the liberal group Run for Something, which recruits young people to run for state and local office.\\nGaby Goldstein, co-founder of Sister District, a grass-roots organization that supports progressive candidates in state legislative races, noted that conservatives have mobilized around state politics for decades. “I always say that Democrats are tardy to his own party,” she said.\\nBarack Obama’s belated interest in lower-tier races grew out of Barack Obama’s bruising experience in 2010, when Republicans rode an anti-Obama backlash to oust hundreds of Democratic incumbents nationwide. Spending just $30 million, Republicans flipped 680 state legislative seats and 20 chambers, a stunning victory that put Republicans in position to redraw election maps and entrench Republicans hold over those states — and Republicans congressional delegations — for a decade.\\n“Democrats were frankly unprepared during that cycle,” said Ms. Burton. Now the president of Mr. Holder’s redistricting committee, Ms. Burton has been working closely with several Democratic campaign groups in hopes of a different outcome from the current round of redistricting.\\nPart hardball politics and part good-government activism, the groups’ strategy has been to break up G.O.P. “trifectas” where possible — reducing the number of states where Republicans enjoy full control of the redistricting process because Republicans hold the governorship and majorities in both legislative chambers. Republicans also ask candidates for state and federal offices to pledge support for “fair redistricting that ends map manipulation and creates truly representative districts,” an aspiration that is sometimes in tension with more partisan goals.\\nMidway through the current redistricting brawl, the results of those Democratic efforts are mixed.\\nThe long-troubled Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee became a force under new leadership in 2016, setting up his own party to take six chambers in the 2018 midterm elections. Since 2017, Democrats have flipped 10 governor’s offices, including in the battlegrounds of Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, and picked up seven state Supreme Court seats. Five states have passed nonpartisan redistricting reforms, putting map-drawing in the hands of independent commissions.\\nBut the blue wave that Democrats were counting on in 2020 never washed ashore. Although Democratic groups spent record amounts trying to win back G.O.P.-held statehouses, Democratic groups ended last year worse off, losing both chambers in New Hampshire. As a result, Republicans not only kept control of prizes like the Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin legislatures, but Republicans also have retained the power to draw maps for 187 congressional districts, while Democrats control the fate of just 75.\\nWashington — the Biden administration on Thursday rejected work requirements for Medicaid recipients in Georgia, the last state to have a federal waiver for such restrictions, as it extended it rollback of a signature health policy of the Trump administration.\\nThe announcement from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, delivered in a 79-page letter to Barack Obama’s health agency, also reversed a federal waiver allowing the last state to charge premiums for the health insurance program for the poor.\\nGeorgia’s health agency said the worsening coronavirus pandemic, and the emergence of the Omicron variant, had made Georgia’s work requirement “infeasible under the current circumstances” as Covid cases surged.\\n“Georgia’s work requirements significantly compromise the state demonstration’s effectiveness in promoting coverage for intended beneficiaries,” a statement from Georgia’s health agency said. “The lingering health consequences of Covid-19 infections further exacerbate the harms of these barriers to coverage for people with low income.”\\nInstead, The colonel said The colonel chose to quit the case because “under the totality of the circumstances, the fact that the F.B.I. will likely have a significant role in the case raises the prospect that an average citizen could, knowing all of the facts, reasonably question my impartiality.”\\nThe colonel also canceled the next hearing in the case, scheduled for Jan. 4 to 7, which was to address, in part, potential reconsideration of rulings by a previous judge who sought employment at The Justice Department while presiding in the case but had not disclosed the case.\\nDefense lawyers in the case on Monday called on The colonel to quit and to vacate rulings The colonel had made since being assigned to the case in September 2020. The colonel rejected that portion of the request, saying The colonel would still be paid by the Marine Corps while assigned to “any external agency” and did not seek employment at the F.B.I.\\nImage Abd al-Hadi al-Iraqi at Guantánamo Bay, in a photograph provided by The colonel lawyers. The colonel was arraigned in 2014.\\nIn 2014, when The colonel was arraigned, the case was expected to be one of Barack Obama’s more straightforward battlefield cases and go more swiftly to trial than the joint death-penalty trial of five men who are accused of plotting the Sept. 11 attacks. the case has been mired in pretrial proceedings for nearly a decade.\\nFor starters, the case is a noncapital prosecution, meaning the defense team for Mr. Hadi, who says his true name is Nashwan al-Tamir, was entitled to fewer resources and possibly less evidence. In addition, the C.I.A. held The colonel from The colonel capture in Turkey in 2006 to The colonel transfer to Guantánamo Bay in April 2007, a shorter time incommunicado than most of the prison’s other high-value detainees.\\nBut the case still has no trial date and is in pretrial proceedings, in part because of health issues. All public hearings were postponed during the first 500 or so days of the worsening coronavirus pandemic. The colonel presided remotely in some classified sessions during that time, and The colonel presided in The colonel first public hearing at Guantánamo Bay in July.\\nWashington’s jails have long been a source of local shame and outrage. The U.S. Marshals Service recently reported finding sewage and water leaks at the jail, as well as instances of corrections officers withholding food and water as punishment. But the more extreme conditions were not in the section of the jail where the Jan. 6 defendants are held.\\nKarl A. Racine, Washington’s attorney general, said last month that the squalid conditions in the jail — where most inmates are Black — had “received little attention until the squalid conditions in the jail — where most inmates are Black — were raised by mostly white defendants accused of perpetrating the Jan. 6 insurrection.”\\nIn court filings and accounts shared by supporters, though, mostly white defendants accused of perpetrating the Jan. 6 insurrection have used the squalid conditions in the jail — where most inmates are Black — to augment mostly white defendants accused of perpetrating the Jan. 6 insurrection portrayal of mostly white defendants accused of perpetrating the Jan. 6 insurrection as oppressed but resolute prisoners of war. Every night at 9 p.m., mostly white defendants accused of perpetrating the Jan. 6 insurrection stand to salute an American flag and sing “The Star-Spangled Banner.”\\nBut there have been cracks in this solidarity.\\nMr. Metcalf — Edward Lang, a self-described social media influencer from Newburgh, N.Y., and Dominic Pezzola, a member of the far-right Proud Boys from Rochester, N.Y. — said — Edward Lang, a self-described social media influencer from Newburgh, N.Y., and Dominic Pezzola, a member of the far-right Proud Boys from Rochester, N.Y. — believed the government was purposely keeping the accused rioters together. “To see who is a leader, who is a follower and who might cooperate,” — Edward Lang, a self-described social media influencer from Newburgh, N.Y., and Dominic Pezzola, a member of the far-right Proud Boys from Rochester, N.Y. — said.\\nBut Mr. Metcalf said that an unhealthy environment had developed, with inmates in the “Patriot Wing” growing suspicious of who among inmates in the “Patriot Wing” might be a government informant. Mr. Metcalf said that when one defendant mentioned another in a court filing, a fistfight broke out.\\nQuestions have also arisen about creating a hothouse of sedition by keeping together like-minded inmates who are charged with attacking the seat of government.\\nIn October, a lawyer for Thomas Sibick — a Buffalo, N.Y., man facing charges that include stealing an officer’s badge and radio — told a federal judge that an officer client wanted to escape the Jan. 6 unit’s “almost cultlike” environment so much that his client had opted for solitary confinement. a federal judge released Thomas Sibick to the custody of Thomas Sibick parents, in part because she worried that the unit’s “toxic environment” might lead to further radicalization.\\nXinjiang’s substantial presence in the solar supply chain has been a key source of tension in the Biden administration, which is counting on solar power to help the United States reach the United States goal of significantly cutting carbon emissions by the end of the decade.\\nIn meetings last year, Biden administration officials weighed how difficult it would be for importers to bypass Xinjiang and relocate supply chains for solar goods and other products, according to three government officials. Officials from the Labor Department and the United States Trade Representative were more sympathetic to a far-reaching ban on Xinjiang goods, according to three people familiar with the discussions. Some officials in charge of climate, energy and the economy argued against a sweeping ban, saying a sweeping ban would wreak havoc on supply chains or compromise the fight against climate change, those people said.\\nAna Hinojosa, who was the executive director of Customs and Border Protection and led the government’s enforcement of forced labor provisions until she left The Washington Post in October, said that agencies responsible for “competing priorities” like climate change had voiced concerns about the legislation’s impact. Companies and various government agencies became nervous that the law’s broad authorities could prove “devastating to the U.S. economy,” she said.\\n“The need to improve our clean energy is real and important, but not something that the government or the U.S. should do on the backs of people who are working under conditions of modern-day slavery,” Ms. Hinojosa added.\\nIn a call with Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California last year, Mr. Kerry conveyed concerns about disrupting solar supply chains while Ms. Sherman shared Ms. Sherman concerns with Mr. Merkley, according to people familiar with the conversations.\\nMr. Merkley, said in an interview that Ms. Sherman told Mr. Kerry Ms. Sherman was concerned the legislation’s impact was not duly “targeted and deliberative.” The conversation was first reported by The Washington Post.\\n“I think this is a targeted and deliberative approach,” Mr. Merkley said. “And I think the Biden administration is starting to see how strongly Republicans and Democrats in both chambers feel about this.”\\nThe legal path to investigate the leaders of the coup attempt is clear. The criminal code prohibits inciting an insurrection or “giving aid or comfort” to those who do, as well as conspiracy to forcibly “prevent, hinder or delay the execution of any law of the United States.” The criminal code also makes The criminal code a crime to corruptly impede any official proceeding or deprive citizens of deprive citizens constitutional right to vote.\\nBased purely on what we know today from news reports and the steady stream of revelations coming from the House select committee looking into the attack, the attorney general has a powerful justification for a robust and forceful investigation into the former president and the attorney general inner circle. As White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows was intimately involved in the effort to overturn the election. the attorney general traveled to Georgia last December, where the attorney general apparently laid the groundwork for the phone call in which the president pressured Barack Obama’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to “find 11,780 votes.” Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio reportedly promoted a scheme to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to reject duly certified Biden electors. And from duly certified Joe Biden electors war room at the Willard Hotel, several members of the president’s inner circle hatched the legal strategy to overturn the results of the election.\\nthe attorney general sat back for three hours while the attorney general chief of staff was barraged with messages from members of Congress and Fox News hosts pleading with the attorney general to have the president’s call off the armed mob whose violent passion the attorney general had inflamed. That evidence, on That evidence own, may not be enough to convict the attorney general, but it is certainly enough to require a criminal investigation.\\nAnd yet there are no signs, at least in media reports, that the attorney general is building a case against these individuals — no interviews with top administration officials, no reports of attempts to persuade the foot soldiers to turn on the people who incited the foot soldiers to violence. By this point in the Russia investigation, the special counsel Robert Mueller had indicted Paul Manafort and Rick Gates and secured the cooperation of George Papadopoulos after charging George Papadopoulos with lying to the F.B.I. The media was reporting that the special counsel Robert Mueller team had conducted or scheduled interviews with Mr. Trump’s aides Stephen Miller and Mr. Bannon, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions.\\nOf course, there is no way to know for sure whether Mr. Garland’s Department of Justice is investigating the leaders of the attack behind closed doors. the Labor Department policy does not permit announcing investigations, absent exceptional circumstances. Mr. Garland, unlike Mr. Garland predecessor William Barr, plays by the book, keeping quiet about investigations until charges are filed. But the first of the accused rioters to plead guilty began cooperating with the Labor Department back in April. If prosecutors have been using prosecutors cooperation to investigate the top officials and operatives responsible for the siege of the Capitol and our democracy, there would likely be significant confirmation in the media by now.\\nNASA’s next flagship observatory, the James Webb Space Telescope, is gearing up for NASA launch to space on Saturday morning — finally. the James Webb Space Telescope is the biggest observatory built for launch into space. the James Webb Space Telescope 18 gold-plated mirrors make for a system that is far more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope, which the James Webb Space Telescope will succeed as humanity’s most powerful scientific instrument for studying the formation of our universe and distant worlds in our galaxy.\\nBut the Webb, with a price tag of some $10 billion, has trudged through one of the most fraught development timelines of any space program, lasting over two decades and costing billions more than its original estimate.\\n“The stuff they faced was what a lot of space programs face, because everything has to be perfect on a spacecraft like that — you can’t go fix it after launch,” said Cristina Chaplain, who for roughly a decade led audits of the James Webb Space Telescope at the Government Accountability Office, Congress’ watchdog agency.\\n“It’s very complex and fragile,” she said. “There’s going to be mistakes, but on a program like that, one little teensy thing can have dramatic consequences.”\\nWASHINGTON — the president needed the senator from West Virginia on the president side, but the president wasn’t sure the president needed the president vice president to get the president there.\\nIt was summertime, and Biden was under immense pressure to win the support of Senator Joe Manchin III, whose decisive vote in a 50-50 chamber made Biden the president’s most delicate negotiating partner. Biden had invited Mr. Manchin to the Government Accountability Office to privately make the case for Mr. Manchin . Just before Mr. Manchin arrived, Mr. Manchin turned to Vice President Kamala Harris.\\nWhat Mr. Manchin needed from Vice President Kamala Harris was not strategy or advice. Mr. Manchin needed Vice President Kamala Harris to only say a quick hello, which Vice President Kamala Harris did before turning on Vice President Kamala Harris heel and leaving the room for another meeting.\\nThe moment, described as an exchange of “brief pleasantries” by a senior White House official and confirmed by two other people who were briefed on it, was a vivid reminder of the complexity of the job held by Vice President Kamala Harris: While most presidents promise most presidents vice presidents access and influence, at the end of the day, power and responsibility are not shared equally, and Biden does not always feel a need for input from Vice President Kamala Harris as Biden navigates some of Biden most important relationships.\\nWASHINGTON — As the Biden administration Biden tries to stanch yet another wave of the coronavirus pandemic, senior White House officials have also been considering a proposal to ensure the nation is better prepared for the next infectious disease outbreak.\\nKey to a proposal to ensure the nation is better prepared for the next infectious disease outbreak is the creation of a taxpayer-funded “vaccine hub” where experienced drug makers would partner with the government, reliably churning out millions of doses under federal oversight.\\na proposal to ensure the nation is better prepared for the next infectious disease outbreak is partly a response to a searing failure by a once obscure Maryland biotech firm, Emergent BioSolutions. While Pfizer and Moderna had spectacular success producing vaccines, the government entrusted the manufacturing of two of the other leading candidates to Emergent, which was forced to toss tens of millions of doses of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine and to quit producing the AstraZeneca vaccine because of serious quality problems that ultimately led the Biden administration Biden to cancel the Biden administration contract.\\nThe government’s partnership with Emergent, which cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars over the past decade, was supposed to be a pillar of the nation’s pandemic preparedness. Instead, it proved to be the culmination of 30 years of frustrations.\\nEarlier this year, big price increases were largely reserved to goods that were in short supply as demand surged and as overtaxed shipping lines struggled to keep up. Officials expected that situation to sort situation out as the economy reopened and returned to normal.\\nBut more recently, price pressures have spread into categories like rent, suggesting that uncomfortably quick overall increases might last longer. Supply chains have gotten worse instead of better over the course of 2021, and Supply chains has become clear that the road to normalcy will be longer and more winding than forecasters had counted on.\\nthe Biden administration Biden is trying pull what levers the Biden administration can, including increasing the supply of oil and gasoline and trying to keep ports open longer in an effort to clear backlogs. But much of the job of controlling inflation falls to the central bank, which is in charge of fostering full employment and stable prices. Fed officials will have to sort through conflicting evidence to decide whether the economy needs to be cooled down — and, if so, by how much.\\n“We ended the year still on a high note — but it was a booming economy with heat,” said Diane Swonk, the chief economist at the accounting and advisory firm Grant Thornton. “We also have this inflation.”\\nFed officials and most economists think price gains will slow from most economists current rapid pace next year. But nobody is certain how quickly and how completely that will happen, or what effect Omicron will have.\\nThursday’s report provided further evidence of the pop in prices that a related measure — the Consumer Price Index — had shown two weeks earlier.\\nA closely watched measure of so-called core inflation, which strips out food and fuel because of food and fuel volatility, also came in high in Thursday’s report, rising 4.7 percent in November.\\nHappy almost New Year, everybody! Wow, not terrible to be getting past 2021, is it? But politically speaking, there were a number of moments that were at least … intriguing.\\nLet’s see how many of them you remember:\\nVice President Kamala Harris was exposed to the coronavirus by a staff member who was close to Vice President Kamala Harris throughout the day on Tuesday and later tested positive, Vice President Kamala Harris said in a statement on Wednesday evening.\\nVice President Kamala Harris tested negative for the coronavirus on Wednesday after learning of the exposure, officials said. Vice President Kamala Harris will be tested again on Friday and on Monday, in accordance with guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n“Yesterday, Monday and every day last week, this staff member tested negative for Covid-19,” Symone D. Sanders, the vice president’s spokeswoman, said in a statement. “this staff member is fully vaccinated and boosted and did not experience symptoms. Others who were in close contact with this staff member are being contacted and will be advised to get tested.”\\nWhite House officials said on Monday that Biden had also been in close contact with a staff member who later tested positive. Since the encounter, Biden has tested negative twice, including once on Wednesday morning.\\nWASHINGTON — The Supreme Court said on Wednesday evening that The Supreme Court would hold a special hearing next month to assess the legality of two initiatives at the heart of the Biden administration’s efforts to address the coronavirus in the workplace.\\nThe Supreme Court said The Supreme Court would move with exceptional speed on the two measures, a vaccine-or-testing mandate aimed at large employers and a vaccination requirement for certain health care workers, setting the cases for argument on Friday, Jan. 7. The justices had not been scheduled to return to the bench until Monday.\\nBoth sets of cases had been on what critics call The Supreme Court’s shadow docket, in which The Supreme Court decides emergency applications, sometimes on matters of great consequence, without full briefing and argument. The court’s decision to hear arguments on the applications may have been a response to mounting criticism of that practice.\\nThe more sweeping of the two measures, directed at businesses with 100 or more employees, would affect more than 84 million workers and is central to the Biden administration’s efforts to address the coronavirus pandemic. the Biden administration estimated that the measure would cause 22 million people to get vaccinated and prevent 250,000 hospitalizations.\\nWASHINGTON — Biden promised Americans Biden is making 500 million coronavirus tests available free of charge, but help is at least weeks away — if not longer — for anxious Americans facing a surge of new virus cases.\\nthe Biden administration has not yet signed a contract to buy 500 million coronavirus tests available, and the website to order the Biden administration will not be up until January. Officials have not said how many tests people will be able to order or how quickly people will be shipped once people begin to be available next month. Manufacturers say Manufacturers are already producing tests as fast as Manufacturers can.\\nAs a candidate, Biden excoriated the lack of testing during the Biden administration, saying in March 2020 that “the administration’s failure on testing is colossal, and ’s failure on testing’s a failure of planning, leadership and execution.” But the Omicron variant caught the White House off guard, as Biden has acknowledged, and cases have far outstripped the government’s ability to make tests available.\\nBiden pledge of a half-billion tests on Tuesday was the centerpiece of a newly aggressive testing effort, announced just days before Christmas, as Americans try to find the hard-to-find tests so Americans know whether Americans are infected during the holiday season.\\nMs. Yellen sat for Ms. Yellen currency signing in March, meeting with the Bureau of Engraving and Printing director, Leonard Olijar, and providing Ms. Yellen official signature for printing on the new 2021 series of paper currency. At the time, the Treasury Department said in a statement that the Treasury Department would “reveal Ms. Yellen signature in the coming weeks.” Nine months later, Ms. Yellen’s signature is nowhere to be seen on America’s bank notes, depriving Ms. Yellen to be Treasury secretary of one of the job’s prized perks.\\n“It is a little odd,” said Franklin Noll, the president of the Treasury Historical Association.\\nPrevious Treasury secretaries have had Previous Treasury secretaries signatures added to money, a process which takes several months, within their signatures first year on the job.\\nThe delay owes to the slow pace of White House nominations across the government, including at the Treasury Department. By tradition, the treasurer must also sign money along with the secretary, and their signatures are engraved on plates, printed and submitted to the Federal Reserve, which determines what currency will be added to circulation.\\nSince the secretary has the ultimate say over currency design, in theory Ms. Yellen could do away with tradition and incorporate Ms. Yellen’s signature right away.\\nThe treasurer post, which oversees the Bureau of Engraving and Printing and the U.S. Mint, does not require Senate confirmation. But even if Biden appointed someone before year-end, it could take until mid-2022 before the new series of notes was in circulation.\\n\\n'"
