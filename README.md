# Tokenization-Coreference-Experiments-on-NYT-Articles

This code consists of the following features:
1. Scraping NYT articles.
2. Tokenizing the text into sentences.
3. Extracting only the sentences when a person is referred to.
4. Inputting the results into a dataframe.

We wanted to see how coreference resolution would change the results, as well as seeing if changing the tokenization model would do anything. And it definetly did.
